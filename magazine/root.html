                Originally, the idea seems to have grown from the common feeling of wanting to escape the turbulent times we are currently enduring. Abgail Morris, one of the print designers, explains: <br/><br/>
                - So many of us have felt the overwhelming desire to be outside, to reconnect with nature and feel a little bit of calm amongst the chaos.                  
                So when she and her colleagues at the H&M design department got the mission to create an authentic looking floral print, they simply took their scetchbooks out to the fields.<br/><br/> Starting with still life, they wanted to portray the wildflowers in their truest form - windswept, scattered and untamed.<br/><br/>                 
                - The collection is about lying in the grass on a summer’s day and noticing raw nature all around you, says Florentin Bodet, another member of the team.

                    “Bring the world a little bit of good news” has been the aim of footwear brand Good News ever since Ben Tattersall and Nia Jones founded it in London in 2016.<br/><br/>
                    Now they’re truly living up to their name with a new sneaker collection featuring innovative materials like Bananatex® — fibre from banana plants — and the vegan grape leather Vegea™.<br/><br/>
                    The forward-thinking collection is set to launch on 1 April.  
                    It all started with waste. During buying trips to footwear factories, fashion industry veterans Jones and Tattersall continuously heard about the amount of waste that was sent straight to landfill. This became a wake-up call.<br/><br/> 
                    The two friends and roommates were determined to change this. They turned their living room into a sample room and spent evenings working toward their long-term vision: a compassionate and sustainable world.<br/><br/> 
                    Today, Good News is a footwear brand renowned for its playful, retro-inspired sneakers and steadfast commitment to sustainability
                    - The collection is about lying in the grass on a summer’s day and noticing raw nature all around you, says Florentin Bodet, another member of the team.

                    Environmental advocate, ecologist and published scientist, ready to change the future of fashion. Zinnia Kumar is not your average fashion model (if there ever was such a thing).<br/><br/>
                    “I was 5 years old when I decided that conservation, animals and the environment were areas I wanted to work in”, she says.<br/> “I was addicted to David Attenborough documentaries at a very early age and I loved learning about Jane Goodall.”<br/><br/>
                    WHAT WAS THE SPARK THAT ALSO MADE YOU INTERESTED IN FASHION?<br/>
                    “I have always been creative. Growing up, I used to paint, draw and create sculptures. Fashion for me is a creative outlet where I become the form, the art piece, the blank slate for collaborative art.<br/><br/> 
                    I am excited by every photographer and designer that I get to work with. I love the unknown element to it, you never quite know what the finished outcome will look like.”

                    “Live with purpose (to protect our future together).” Eight words to sum up the core message of Edition By Héctor Bellerín — an agenda-pushing collection co-created with the international football player.<br/><br/> 
                    The same words reappear as a graphic theme throughout the new menswear line, which is set to launch on 18 February.
                    There’s undoubtedly more to Héctor Bellerín than exceptional speed. The multitalented Spaniard has earned recognition not only for his athletic skills, but for being a fierce advocate for sustainability and social responsibility.<br/><br/>
                    Through his creative pursuits, such as photography and painting, he has also proven an artistic vigour that comes through in his forward-thinking fashion choices.
                    “Héctor has an expert eye for style, in tune with how men are dressing right now,” says Ross Lydon, who’s the head of menswear design at H&M. “It’s a look that’s both sharp and effortless, combining streetwear with utilitarianism, and always with a sense of ease and positivity.”

                    “Our first beauty buys of the new season: a warm-toned eyeshadow and a glowy priming oil.<br/> 
                    Start by doing your base the way you like it (we prefer au natural most days.) Add some bronzer to your cheekbones and brush your eyebrows upwards, not overdoing them.<br/><br/>
                    For the eyes, we used the INTO THE SUNSET palette, which is full of beautiful, warm shades. It has earthy, matte tones plus a few shimmery metallics – meaning this palette works just as well for everyday makeup as for an all-in party look.<br/><br/>
                    Apply a thin layer of the light shade Barefoot all over your eyelid and to the inner corner of your eye. Mix the two orange tones Smores and Bonfire to your desired intensity and apply it along the globe line (not onto your eyelids) and up towards the brow bone. Use a bigger eyeshadow brush for a soft look and smooth edges. Use more of the Smores shade for a subtle, warm tone, and more of Bonfire for a distinct orange tone.
